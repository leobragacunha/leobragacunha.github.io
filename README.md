# Welcome to SportFlix, the sports stream!

This is a project focused on <b>Javascript</b>. The main goal is to develop some features, like:

- Page scrolling
- Tab components
- Sliders
- Modal windows

I also tested some API uses, but the main goal was to work with the IntersectionObserver API to show sections as the screen scrolls down.

Please don't mind the amateur design. It's not the main goal here! I just tried to make a nice personal project to test my front end skills!

Hope you enjoy!!!
